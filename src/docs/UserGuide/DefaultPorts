==== What are the default ports?

TCP ports are used in all situations.

|===========================================================================
| node collector port      | +flume.collector.port+                 | 35853+
| node status web server   | +flume.node.http.port+                 | 35862+
| master status web server | +flume.master.http.port+               | 35871
| master heartbeat port    | +flume.master.heartbeat.port+          | 35872
| master admin/shell port  | +flume.master.admin.port+              | 35873
| master gossip port       | +flume.master.gossip.port+             | 57890  
| master report port       | +flume.report.server.port+             | 45678
| master -> zk port        | +flume.master.zk.client.port+          |  3181
| zk -> zk quorum port     | +flume.master.zk.server.quorum.port+   |  3182
| zk -> zk election port   | +flume.master.zk.server.election.port+ |  3183
|===========================================================================

When using auto chains for collectors, each collector source will
automatically search for a free port by incrementing starting from
port +flume.collector.port+ and incrementing the port number.   

When there is more than one physical node on a machine, the node
status web server will attempt to bind to port +flume.node.http.port+.
If the bind fails, the port number will be incremented and the bind
retried until a free port is found.  The port that is eventually bound
to is logged.
