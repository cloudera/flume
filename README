h1. Welcome to Flume!

NOTE: We have moved to the Apache Incubator. https://cwiki.apache.org/FLUME/

Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for
efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log
data. It has a simple and flexible architecture based on streaming
data flows. It is robust and fault tolerant with tunable reliability
mechanisms and many failover and recovery mechanisms. The system is
centrally managed and allows for intelligent dynamic management. It
uses a simple extensible data model that allows for online analytic
application
