=== Running Tests

The core suite of tests (located in src/javatest) can be run by
using `ant test`.

To run only a specific test class, you can add a special argument to
the command line: `ant test -Dtestcase=<TestClass>` where
`<TestClass>` is the name of a unit test class.

Sometimes you may want to run all tests except for a few specific ones
(flaky tests perhaps).  This can be done by running `ant test
-Dtest.exclude.file=<file>`

Sometimes you may want to run only a selected set of tests.  This can
be done by running `ant test -Dtest.include.file=<file>`

In both of these cases the tests are specified line by line in ant
fileset format. The following example will recursively select all
files that start with TestFoo.
