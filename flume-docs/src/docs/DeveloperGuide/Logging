=== Logging

Logging is implemented using the http://www.slf4j.org/[SLF4J API].

Be sure to read the http://www.slf4j.org/docs.html[SLF4J documentation].

==== Setting Up Logging

Typically each class has its own logger. We declare these as follows:

[source,java]
----
private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class);
----

Things to note here:

* We make all loggers ++private static final++ (and in that order).
* We name all of our loggers ++LOG++.
* We just pass the class, we don't call ++.getName()++ on the class.

==== Logging Exceptions

We are using the 1.6 version of SLF4J, so we get to take advantage of
the http://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#paramException[improved support] for
logging exceptions.

==== Logging Formatting and Performance Notes

For a good discussion of this, see the
http://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#logging_performance[relevant section]
in the SLF4J FAQ.
