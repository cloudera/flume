== Flume on Microsoft Windows-based Machines


image:flume-logo.png[]

Flume v0.9.3 is the first version of Flume to support Windows-based
Flume nodes.  It has been tested on Window Server 2003 SP2 and Windows
XP SP3 machines and can be used to collect logs generated from Windows
applications such as Microsoft IIS.

Requirements:

* Sun/Oracle 32-bit Windows JRE v1.6+

NOTE: We require using the 32-bit JVM even on 64 bit machines because
of lower memory footprint.

=== Installation

Flume for Windows is installed using an executable installer generated
by Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS).  It provides a simple
wizard which presents basic options for a node's configuration
settings.  It will install the software and optionally start a Flume
node as a Windows service (daemon).

NOTE: Before reinstalling the Flume on Windows service, use the
Windows Services Management Console to stop the +flumenode.exe+
service.

When you start the Flume for Windows installer, the following dialog
box appears.  Click "Next".

Read the license agreement and then click "I Agree".

In the drop-down menu in the following dialog box, specify whether you
want to install the Flume node core software, or install the Flume
node core software and install it as a Windows service.  Installing as
a service will add the Flume node service that is started when the
machine is rebooted.  

Select the components you want to install and then click "Next" to
continue.

Specify the Flume node's master location. The default is "localhost"
which specifies the current machine.  To specify a different machine,
enter either its IP address or machine name.  Also, specify the TCP
port for node-to-master communications.  The default port is
35862. Click "Next" to continue.

Next the installer attempts to automatically detect the location of an
installed Java Runtime Environment (JRE).  If the JRE is not found,
manually specify the path.  Click "Next".

WARNING: Currently the installer requires a 32-bit JVM.  Using a
64-bit JVM is not supported yet.

Specify the directory where you want to install the Flume for Windows
components, and then click "Install".

After installation is complete, the following dialog box appears.
Click "Finish".

You can confirm that the Flume node is up by:

* Opening a browser to http://localhost:35862 
* Checking that the +flumenode.exe+ service is started in the Windows
  Task Manager or in the Windows Services Management Console
* Seeing the following tray icon:

=== Administering Windows Flume Nodes

Installation by default will set up the Flume node to automatically
start when the Windows machine is booted.  You can manually start and
stop the Flume node service by using:

* The tray icon applet
* The +sc+ (service controller) windows command line program 
* The Windows Service Management Console

You can use the tray icon applet to start, stop, or restart the Flume
node service. You can access the commands by right clicking on the
tray icon and displaying the following menu:

image:flume-tray-menu.png[]

Click "Configure..." to change the Flume node service configuration
settings, such as JVM parameters and the Restart-on-reboot mode.

NOTE: Flume relies on Apache Common Daemon's +prunmgr.exe+ and
+prunsvr.exe+ programs.  These have been renamed to +flumenode.exe+
and +flumenodew.exe+.  The first runs the Flume node as a Windows
Service, and the second provides the tray icon configuration
interface.

Alternately, you can start and stop the Flume node service by typing
the following commands (as the Administrator) at the Windows command
prompt:

----
C:\> sc FlumeNode start
C:\> sc FlumeNode stop
----

Run +sc+ for more details and options.

Unfortunately, the +install+, +delete+, and +create+ methods do not
always work.  To manually install and uninstall the Flume node
service, run the following scripts from the command prompt (as
Administrator) at the Windows command prompt:

----
%FLUME_HOME%\bin\> flumenode-service.bat install

$FLUME_HOME%\bin\> flumenode-service.bat remove
----

WARNING: Uninstalling Flume node may not be completed cleanly.  You
may need to stop +flumenode.exe+ and +flumenodew.exe+ using the Task
Manager.

=== Default Directories.

The installation directory where the Flume node programs are installed
is called +%FLUME_HOME%+.  By default this is +C:\Program
Files\Cloudera\Flume 0.9.3\+.

[width="50%",options="header"]
|=================================================================================
|Directory          |Purpose
|%FLUME_HOME%\logs  |Directory where Flume node logs are saved.
|%FLUME_HOME%\conf  |Directory where flume-site.xml and flume-conf.xml are located
|=================================================================================

The +FLUME_CONF_DIR+ environment variable is respected -- you can keep
xml configs in a separate directory pointed to by this variable for
customized configurations.

=== Building Flume for Windows

To build Flume for Windows, you need:

* Sun/Oracle JDK v1.6.x+
* cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/)
* ant (http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi, .zip version)
* NSIS (we are using v2.46, http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page)

With cygwin the normal Unix build process can be used.  For example,
assuming you are in the Flume project directory, type this command:

----
~/flume$ ant 
-----

To generate the Flume installer executable, run the following special
ant filter to inject the proper build-specific versions information:

----
~/flume$ ant winstall-filter
----

You can build the Flume for Windows installer manually. Start NSIS,
and then click "Compile NSI script". In the dialog box that opens,
select "File | Load scriptâ€¦" from the menu. Select flume/flume.nsi,
and then click "Open". This will compile the script and generate the
installer, +flume-installer.exe+. This file should be located in the
main Flume project directory.
